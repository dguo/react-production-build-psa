# Contributing
Create pull requests to add or remove entries from the list. I try to contact
the websites to let them know about the issue. If you're adding one, let me
know if you have already tried to contact them or if you would like me to do
so.

Please do not create a pull request if the website is using an out of date
build. Turning on the production build *should* be an easy and safe change, but
upgrading React might involve much more significant changes, depending on the
code base. Developers also probably already know that React releases new
versions regularly.
